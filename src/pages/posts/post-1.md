Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here I will share my progress
on learning more about Astro and the current tutorial I'm doing.

## What I've done so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new astro project, set up git and
netlify hosting.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to create new pages. About and blog
were the first pages I made.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post, written in markdown.
I now have a new way of sharing, which is interesting.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, then look into how I can create a template
that looks great to test out product ideas I have. I'm hoping that no CMS
will be necessary other than git itself.
